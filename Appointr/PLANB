Appointment
	Has a time
	Has a date
	Has a place
	*Involves people

People
	Have identifying info
	Have a schedule
		Schedules HAVE appointments




Calendar - Value (Can be array or object)
	Day - Value (Can be array or object)
		Appointment
			Client
			Employee
				Availability
				ID
			Room
				Number
			Start Time
			Duration


ABOVE: Employee and client is needed by Appointment to know who the appointment involves
Appointment is needed by Schedule needed by Employee to determine availability
Circular dependence

Solution: Use primary keys like in a database
	Appointment only contains Employee ID and client ID ints to compare to those contained by the class objects instead of holding a reference to the object
