Astrol is a program that generates a random password based on a number of factors unique to your system!

These factors include your hostname, system uptime at the time the program is run, and the date your computer was turned on.

Command-line syntax:

./astrol (optional cipher)

The optional cipher will scramble your password that is generated from your computer's "star sign." The default value for the cipher is your hostname.
